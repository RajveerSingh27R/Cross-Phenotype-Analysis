# Cross-Phenotype-Analysis
Gene expression profiling and protein-protein network analysis revealed prognostic hub biomarkers linking cancer risk in type 2 diabetic patients

In this study, we followed computational approaches using the raw gene expression data of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of T2DM and cancer patients publicly available at the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. Our analysis identified shared differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in T2DM and three common cancer types namely, pancreatic cancer (PC), liver cancer (LC) and breast cancer (BC).
